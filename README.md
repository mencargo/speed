# HTML5 Speedtest

No Flash, No Java, No Websocket, No Bullshit.

This is a very lightweight Speedtest implemented in Javascript, using XMLHttpRequest and Web Workers.

## Try it
[Take a Speedtest](http://speedtest.fdossena.com)

## Compatibility
Only modern browsers are supported (IE11, latest Edge, latest Chrome, latest Firefox, latest Safari)

## Features
* Download
* Upload
* Ping
* Jitter
* IP Address
* Telemetry (optional)

## Requirements
 - A reasonably fast web server with PHP (see doc.md for details and use without PHP)
 - Your server must accept large POST requests (up to 20 Megabytes), otherwise the upload test will fail
 - It's also better if your server does not use compression, but it's not mandatory
